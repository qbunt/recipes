*Makes sixteen 4-inch pancakes; 4 to 6*

- 2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- ¼ cup plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1 ½ cups milk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

1) Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in large bowl. Whisk eggs and ¼ cup oil in second medium bowl until well combined. Whisk milk and vanilla into egg mixture. Add egg mixture to flour mixture and stir gently until just combined (batter should remain lumpy with few streaks of flour). Let batter sit for 10 minutes before cooking.

1) Heat ½ teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until shimmering. Using paper towels, carefully wipe out oil, leaving thin film on bottom and sides of skillet. Drop 1 tablespoon batter in center of skillet. If pancake is pale golden brown after 1 minute, skillet is ready. If it is too light or too dark, adjust heat accordingly.

1) Using ¼-cup dry measuring cup, portion batter into skillet in 3 places, leaving 2 inches between portions. If necessary, gently spread batter into 4-inch round. Cook until edges are set, first sides are golden brown, and bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, 2 to 3 minutes. Using thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and continue to cook until second sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Serve. Repeat with remaining batter, using remaining ½ teaspoon oil as necessary.

## Extend the Life of Leftover Pancakes
If you’ve got leftover pancakes, don’t toss them. Use these simple tips to store and reheat them for another breakfast.

**How to Store:** Place cooled pancakes in zipper-lock bag, separating them with pieces of waxed paper, parchment paper, or aluminum foil and pressing on bag to eliminate air pockets before sealing. Refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 2 weeks.

**How to Reheat:** Place pancakes on rimmed baking sheet and heat in 325-degree oven (or toaster oven) until warmed through, 3 to 4 minutes if refrigerated and about 6 minutes if frozen.

## Mixin strategy
We don’t suggest stirring fruit, chocolate chips, or nuts directly into thick pancake batters, such as that for our Easy Pancakes. This will overmix the batter, compromising the pancakes’ height and texture. Instead, add items (cut into ½-inch pieces) immediately after portioning the batter into the skillet. The batter will partially surround the add-ins during cooking.

## Troubleshooting Pancakes
To produce consistently round, golden-brown pancakes, follow these three tips.

### Problem: Surface is too pale/too dark

Solution: Make tester pancake

Method: To determine if the temperature of your skillet is correct, drop 1 tablespoon of batter onto the heated surface. If it is golden brown after 1 minute, you're ready to cook. If not, adjust the heat as necessary.

### Problem: Spotty browning

Solution: Wipe away excess oil

Method: After adding oil to the skillet, wipe it out until there is just a bare sheen remaining. (Metal transfers heat better than oil, so places where oil pools under the pancake will cook more slowly and be relatively pale.)

### Problem: Messy flipping

Solution: Flip low and quickly

Method: Slide a thin spatula underneath the pancake and flip it in a smooth, quick motion, keeping the spatula close to the cooking surface.
